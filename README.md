# OP-Autoclicker-download-for-school-computers
Most likely you'll have an 'OP Autoclicker' website where you get the autoclicker from is blocked on your school PC, so i decided to upload a download link here on GitHub which most likely isnt blocked on your school's PC. Have fun :)
In order to install just simply download the '.exe' file and open it in your File Explorer.
Version that is used is 3.1.1
I will be putting new versions every 6 months (they all are pretty much the same)
